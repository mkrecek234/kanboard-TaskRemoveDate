Automatic action: Remove due date when moving cards
=================================================

This plugin allows you to create an automatic action in Kanboard that remove the due date of a card
when moved to a user specified column. The former due date will be stored in the reference field (pre-poned).

The goal is to make updating due dates easier during a drag and drop operation.

When adding an automatic action, the action name is shown as
"Automatically remove the task due date when the task is moved to another column"
